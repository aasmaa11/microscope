Step to run unit tests
*****************
1. Make sure you are in the 'test' folder. Use ``cd ./path_to_test_folder/test`` from the command line.
2. From there, use the ``python -m unittest`` command to start all test units from all files inside the current folder.

Note: test_ASIStage.py and test_ASIStageAxis.py will test the asi_handler found under the asi folder.
